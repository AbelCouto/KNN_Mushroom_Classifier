# KNN_Mushroom_Classifier
 My first model for my Machine learning assignment.  Graded 66 marks
 
## Overview
 
* This dataset originally taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification), contains hypothetical samples of 23 gilled mushrooms.
* Heat-map was used to asses feature importance of mushrooms
* Using KNN, the scope of the project was to classify mushrooms based on 22 features on whether they are poisonous or not. 
*One-hot encoding was used to transform categorical data into numerical.
*Different Ks were used to asses performance, when the value of K was set between 1 and 5, the accuracy levels were at 100%.
* The 5-fold method was used to Cross validate the performance of the model, leading to a decrease of 8% when looking at the mean score.
* Accuracy of the model after cross validation were inbetween 91% to 95% with K range from 1 to 5.
